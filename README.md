### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working at total logistics as a full-stack programmer, I use the following technologies to develop software/solutions for the company.
- ASP.NET Core 5.0
- Blazor Server / Blazor Wasm 
- SQL Server
- API

 I have worked on several interesting projects in the last few years, such as:
1. Build custom triggers to format TLT Loads information into a specific JSON format and send it to the FourKites tracking platform via API.
2. Use a webhook listener to receive truck location information.
3. Build various online programs to help companies to do their daily work more easily.

I have always believed that programming is all about managing actions and, moreover, it is a matter of constantly learning and improving ourselves.
